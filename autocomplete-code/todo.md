# VSCode Autocomplete Extension - Development Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)

### 1. Research VSCode Extension Development Fundamentals and APIs ✅
- [x] Study VSCode extension architecture and lifecycle
- [x] Learn CompletionItemProvider API
- [x] Understand language features and contribution points
- [x] Review existing autocomplete extensions for best practices

### 2. Set up Development Environment and Project Structure ✅
- [x] Initialize TypeScript project with proper configuration
- [x] Set up webpack for bundling
- [x] Configure testing framework (Jest/Mocha)
- [x] Create basic extension manifest (package.json)
- [x] Set up development and debugging workflow

### 3. Implement Completion Provider with Basic Text Suggestions
- [ ] Create CompletionItemProvider implementation
- [ ] Register completion provider for target languages
- [ ] Implement basic text-based suggestions
- [ ] Add completion item ranking and filtering
- [ ] Test basic functionality in development host

## Phase 2: Core Intelligence (Medium Priority)

### 4. Integrate AI/ML Model for Intelligent Completions
- [ ] Research AI model options (OpenAI, local models, custom endpoints)
- [ ] Implement API client for chosen AI service
- [ ] Handle authentication and API key management
- [ ] Create prompt engineering for code completion
- [ ] Add error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 5. Add Context-Aware Suggestions Based on File Type and Content
- [ ] Analyze current file content and cursor position
- [ ] Extract relevant context (imports, functions, variables)
- [ ] Implement project structure analysis
- [ ] Add language-specific context extraction
- [ ] Create context-aware prompt generation

### 6. Implement Real-time Completion Triggers and Filtering
- [ ] Configure intelligent trigger characters
- [ ] Implement debouncing for API calls
- [ ] Add completion result filtering and ranking
- [ ] Optimize trigger timing and conditions
- [ ] Handle multiple concurrent requests

## Phase 3: Enhancement (Medium/Low Priority)

### 7. Add Configuration Options and User Preferences
- [ ] Define configuration schema in package.json
- [ ] Implement settings for model selection
- [ ] Add trigger behavior customization
- [ ] Create filtering preference options
- [ ] Add UI for extension settings

### 8. Implement Caching and Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Add completion result caching
- [ ] Implement smart cache invalidation
- [ ] Optimize API call frequency
- [ ] Add request cancellation for outdated queries
- [ ] Monitor and optimize memory usage

### 9. Add Telemetry and Usage Analytics
- [ ] Implement completion acceptance tracking
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Create usage pattern analytics
- [ ] Ensure privacy compliance
- [ ] Add opt-out mechanisms

## Phase 4: Distribution (Low Priority)

### 10. Package and publish Extension to Marketplace
- [ ] Finalize extension metadata and descriptions
- [ ] Create extension icon and screenshots
- [ ] Write comprehensive README and documentation
- [ ] Package extension with vsce
- [ ] Publish to VSCode Marketplace
- [ ] Set up automated CI/CD pipeline

## Key Technical Components

### Extension Architecture
- **Extension Manifest** (`package.json`) - Define activation events and contributions
- **Completion Provider** - Core logic for generating and ranking suggestions
- **Language Server** (optional) - For advanced language-specific features
- **Configuration Schema** - User-customizable settings
- **Authentication** - Secure API key management for AI services

### Development Tools
- TypeScript for type safety
- Webpack for bundling
- Jest/Mocha for testing
- ESLint for code quality
- VSCode Extension API

### AI Integration
- Model selection (OpenAI GPT, local models, custom endpoints)
- Prompt engineering for code completion
- Context extraction and analysis
- Response processing and ranking

## Success Metrics
- Completion acceptance rate
- Response time under 500ms
- User satisfaction and adoption
- Extension stability and error rates
